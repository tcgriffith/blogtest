<h2>hmmm</h2>
<p>This post is to test if netlify is continuously updating my blogpost as declared. Iâ€™ll update shortly if it succeeded.</p>
<p>*** 2017-07-07 15:17:28 It succeeded!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>workflow that works:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>addins - new post - do the post</p></li>
<li><p>serve site, which generates an html in the ./content/ dir and lots of others in the ./public/ dir, only commit the html in the ./content/ dir because netlify will deploy again using hugo on the server side.</p></li>
<li><p>commit + push &amp; wait for netlify to pick it up and deploy the changes.</p></li>
</ul>
