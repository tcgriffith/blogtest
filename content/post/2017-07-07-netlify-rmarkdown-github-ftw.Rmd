## hmmm

This post is to test if netlify is continuously updating my blogpost as declared. I'll update shortly if it succeeded.

*** `r Sys.time()` 
It succeeded!

## Summary

workflow that works:

- addins - new post - do the post

- serve site, which generates an html in the ./content/ dir and lots of others in the ./public/ dir, only commit the html in the ./content/ dir because netlify will deploy again using hugo on the server side.

- commit + push & wait for netlify to pick it up and deploy the changes.
